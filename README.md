cd wordle

# Run the word list demo
go run server/main.go server/wordlist.go

# Run tests
cd server && go test -v
```

## Server

The server component includes a robust word list management system implemented in Go:

- **Word List Management**: Load and validate Wordle words

- âœ… Load 14,855 valid Wordle words
- âœ… Case-insensitive word validation
- âœ… Random word selection
- âœ… Word filtering by length
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… Memory-efficient data structures

### Planned Features

- ðŸ”„ Game state management
- ðŸ”„ Turn-based gameplay API
- ðŸ”„ Guess validation and scoring
- ðŸ”„ Database integration for game history
- ðŸ”„ Player statistics
- ðŸ”„ REST API endpoints


### Display Features (Planned)

- letter in word, but wrong spot
- letter in word, correct spot
- handle multiple letters
- show previous answers
- annotate answers (yellow, green)

## Development
